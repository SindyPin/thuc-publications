    "abstract": "Long COVID, or post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), is a major global health problem, with cumulative estimates suggesting that around 400 million people worldwide have been affected. It is characterized by persistent or new symptoms such as fatigue, cognitive impairment, and breathlessness lasting beyond four weeks after acute infection. Diverse clinical manifestations, chronic course, and incompletely understood pathophysiology-including hypotheses involving viral persistence, immune dysregulation, autoimmunity, endothelial dysfunction, and metabolic reprogramming-impede the development of diagnostic criteria, biomarkers, and targeted therapies. We conducted a critical review of 101 Long COVID omics studies, focusing on the computational methods used and their methodological quality. Using standardized criteria, we evaluated study design, statistical rigor, reproducibility, and clinical relevance across genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and multiomics integration, and mapped these findings onto regulatory and translational frameworks. Despite substantial methodological heterogeneity, convergent biological signals emerged. Genomic studies implicate risk loci in immune and cardiopulmonary pathways. Epigenomic analyses identify differentially methylated regions in immune and circadian genes. Transcriptomic studies reveal persistent dysregulation of innate immune and coagulation pathways, as well as reproducible molecular endotypes. Proteomic studies consistently show abnormalities in the complement cascade and coagulation, with a small panel of complement proteins showing highly reproducible changes across independent cohorts. Metabolomic studies demonstrate sustained mitochondrial dysfunction and altered cellular bioenergetics for up to two years after infection. Multiomics integration supports at least two major endotypes, characterized by predominant inflammatory versus metabolic dysregulation, and provides a basis for patient stratification and computational treatment discovery. Machine learning models frequently achieve high classification performance, but are rarely externally validated. Critical limitations restrict clinical translation. Most studies are underpowered relative to analytical complexity, use heterogeneous case definitions and controls, and report platform-specific signatures with limited overlap. External validation, preregistered analysis plans, and regulatory-aligned assay development are uncommon. To date, no regulatory-approved diagnostic assay or evidence-based therapeutic intervention has directly emerged from these computational findings. Future progress requires harmonized phenotyping protocols, adequately powered longitudinal cohorts with external validation, integration of spatial omics and explainable artificial intelligence, and early engagement with regulatory and health-technology assessment pathways. This review provides a critical assessment and a translational roadmap, outlining how methodologically robust computational omics can be advanced toward clinically actionable tools for Long COVID."

    "abstract": "Estimating peer causal effects within complex real-world networks such as social networks is challenging, primarily due to simultaneous feedback between peers and unobserved confounders. Existing methods either address unobserved confounders while ignoring the simultaneous feedback, or account for feedback but under restrictive linear assumptions, thus failing to obtain accurate peer effect estimation. In this paper, we propose DIG2RSI, a novel Deep learning framework which leverages I-G transformation (matrix operation) and 2SRI (an instrumental variable or IV technique) to address both simultaneous feedback and unobserved confounding, while accommodating complex, nonlinear and high-dimensional relationships. DIG2RSI first applies the I-G transformation to disentangle mutual peer influences and eliminate the bias due to the simultaneous feedback. To deal with unobserved confounding, we first construct valid IVs from network data. In stage 1 of 2RSI, we train a neural network on these IVs to predict peer exposure, and extract residuals as proxies for the unobserved confounders. In the stage 2, we fit a separate neural network augmented by an adversarial discriminator that incorporates these residuals as a control function and enforces the learned representation to contain no residual confounding signal. The expressive power of deep learning models in capturing complex non-linear relationships and adversarial debiasing enhances the effectiveness of DIG2RSI in eliminating bias from both feedback loops and hidden confounders. We prove consistency of our estimator under standard regularity conditions, ensuring asymptotic recovery of the true peer effect. Empirical results on two semi-synthetic benchmarks and a real-world dataset demonstrate that DIG2RSI outperforms existing approaches."

    "abstract": "In high-stakes domains such as healthcare, finance, and law, the need for explainable AI is critical. Traditional methods for generating attribution maps, including white-box approaches relying on gradients and black-box techniques that perturb inputs, face challenges like gradient vanishing, blurred attributions, and computational inefficiencies. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel approach that leverages diffusion models within the framework of Information Bottleneck (IB) theory. By utilizing the Gaussian noise from diffusion models, we connect the information bottleneck with the Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE) from classical information theory, enabling precise calculation of mutual information. This connection leads to a new loss function that minimizes the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), facilitating efficient optimization and producing high-resolution, pixel-level attribution maps. Our method achieves greater clarity and accuracy in attributions than existing techniques, requiring significantly fewer pixel values to reach the necessary predictive confidence. This work demonstrates the power of diffusion models in advancing explainable AI, particularly in identifying critical input features with high precision."

Although demographic and clinical factors, such as age, sex, and comorbidities, contribute to risk, the genetic mechanisms underlying this risk remain poorly defined. To address this gap, we developed a multi-omics framework that integrates Transcriptome-Wide Mendelian Randomization (TWMR), Control Theory (CT), Expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTL), Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS), RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) network to identify putative causal genes and network drivers in Long COVID. Our approach prioritized 32 candidate genes, including 19 previously reported and 13 novel, with roles in the SARS-CoV-2 response, viral carcinogenesis, immune regulation, and cell cycle control. Enrichment analyses revealed a shared genetic architecture in syndromic, metabolic, autoimmune, and connective tissue disorders. Using causal gene expression profiles, we identified three distinct symptom-based subtypes of Long COVID, providing information on the heterogeneity of disease mechanisms and clinical presentation. Finally, we developed an open-source Shiny application for interactive exploration of these findings. Together, this integrative framework highlights novel causal mechanisms and therapeutic targets, advancing precision medicine strategies for Long COVID."

To address this, we propose the Zero Inflation Diffusion Framework (ZIDF), which integrates Gaussian perturbation for smoothing zero-inflated distributions, Transformer-based prediction for capturing temporal patterns, and diffusion-based denoising to restore the original data structure. In our experiments, we use observational precipitation data collected from South Australia along with synthetically generated zero-inflated data. Results show that ZIDF demonstrates significant performance improvements over multiple state-of-the-art precipitation forecasting models, achieving up to 56.7\\% reduction in MSE and 21.1\\% reduction in MAE relative to the baseline Non-stationary Transformer. These findings highlight ZIDF's ability to robustly handle sparse time series data and suggest its potential generalizability to other domains where zero inflation is a key challenge."

    "abstract": "In whole slide images (WSIs) analysis, attention-based multi-instance learning (MIL) models are susceptible to spurious correlations and degrade under domain shift. These methods may assign high attention weights to non-tumor regions, such as staining biases or artifacts, leading to unreliable tumor region localization. In this paper, we revisit max-pooling-based MIL methods from a causal perspective. Under mild assumptions, our theoretical results demonstrate that max-pooling encourages the model to focus on causal factors while ignoring bias-related factors. Furthermore, we discover that existing max-pooling-based methods may overfit the training set through rote memorization of instance features and fail to learn meaningful patterns. To address these issues, we propose FocusMIL, which couples max-pooling with an instance-level variational information bottleneck (VIB) to learn compact, predictive latent representations, and employs a multi-bag mini-batch scheme to stabilize optimization. We conduct comprehensive experiments on three real-world datasets and one semi-synthetic dataset. The results show that, by capturing causal factors, FocusMIL exhibits significant advantages in out-of-distribution scenarios and instance-level tumor region localization tasks."

    "abstract": "Querying causal effects from time-series data is important across various fields, including healthcare, economics, climate science, and epidemiology. However, this task becomes complex in the existence of time-varying latent confounders, which affect both treatment and outcome variables over time and can introduce bias in causal effect estimation. Traditional instrumental variable (IV) methods are limited in addressing such complexities due to the need for predefined IVs or strong assumptions that do not hold in dynamic settings. To tackle these issues, we develop a novel Time-varying Conditional Instrumental Variables (CIV) for Debiasing causal effect estimation, referred to as TDCIV. TDCIV leverages Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Variational Autoencoder (VAE) models to disentangle and learn the representations of time-varying CIV and its conditioning set from proxy variables without prior knowledge. Under the assumptions of the Markov property and availability of proxy variables, we theoretically establish the validity of these learned representations for addressing the biases from time-varying latent confounders, thus enabling accurate causal effect estimation. Our proposed TDCIV is the first to effectively learn time-varying CIV and its associated conditioning set without relying on domain-specific knowledge."

    "abstract": "Latent confounders are a fundamental challenge for inferring causal effects from observational data. The instrumental variable (IV) approach is a practical way to address this challenge. Existing IV-based estimators need a known IV or other strong assumptions, such as the existence of two or more IVs in the system, which limits the application of the IV approach. In this article, we consider a relaxed requirement, which assumes there is an IV proxy in the system without knowing which variable is the proxy. We propose a variational autoencoder (VAE)-based disentangled representation learning method to learn an IV representation from a dataset with latent confounders and then utilize the IV representation to obtain an unbiased estimation of the causal effect from the data. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world data have demonstrated that the proposed algorithm outperforms the existing IV-based estimators and VAE-based estimators."

    "abstract": "As the growing demand for long sequence time-series forecasting in real-world applications, such as electricity consumption planning, the significance of time series forecasting becomes increasingly crucial across various domains. This is highlighted by recent advancements in representation learning within the field. This study introduces a novel multi-view approach for time series forecasting that innovatively integrates trend and seasonal representations with an Independent Component Analysis (ICA)-based representation. Recognizing the limitations of existing methods in representing complex and high-dimensional time series data, this research addresses the challenge by combining TS (trend and seasonality) and ICA (independent components) perspectives. This approach offers a holistic understanding of time series data, going beyond traditional models that often miss nuanced, nonlinear relationships. The efficacy of TSI model is demonstrated through comprehensive testing on various benchmark datasets, where it shows superior performance over current state-of-the-art models, particularly in multivariate forecasting. This method not only enhances the accuracy of forecasting but also contributes significantly to the field by providing a more in-depth understanding of time series data. The research which uses ICA for a view lays the groundwork for further exploration and methodological advancements in time series forecasting, opening new avenues for research and practical applications."

    "abstract": "Cancer progression is driven by complex gene interactions, which are not fully understood due to the dynamic and multifaceted nature of the disease. Traditional methods for identifying genes driving cancer typically focus on detecting mutational events, often neglecting other genetic alterations and the temporal dynamics of the cancer development. This study introduces a novel approach that expands our understanding of cancer by identifying cooperative networks of cancer drivers through dynamic causal inference, complementing classical mutation-based methods. We developed a data-driven causal inference method that integrates a temporal dimension to gene expression data through pseudotime analysis. By modelling cancer progression as a dynamic system, the method evaluates gene interactions and their causal relationships using causal kinetic models (CKMs). This approach enables detecting cancer driver genes regardless of their mutational status. The approach was applied to both single cell and bulk sequencing datasets of breast cancer to identify and rank cancer driver genes based on their stability on the causal model. The proposed method effectively identifies and ranks cancer driver genes by considering their dynamic interactions during cancer progression. It systematically identified cancer driver genes in both categories: those with single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and those with other alterations. The method demonstrated a significant overlap with known cancer driver genes from the Cancer Gene Census, validating its effectiveness. Additionally, the method uncovered novel driver genes that act cooperatively to influence cancer development, offering a more comprehensive view of the genetic mechanisms underlying cancer.

    "abstract": "Intervention intuition is often used in model explanation where the intervention effect of a feature on the outcome is quantified by the difference of a model prediction when the feature value is changed from the current value to the baseline value. Such a model intervention effect of a feature is inherently association. In this paper, we will study the conditions when an intuitive model intervention effect has a causal interpretation, i.e., when it indicates whether a feature is a direct cause of the outcome. This work links the model intervention effect to the causal interpretation of a model. Such an interpretation capability is important since it indicates whether a machine learning model is trustworthy to domain experts. The conditions also reveal the limitations of using a model intervention effect for causal interpretation in an environment with unobserved features. Experiments on semi-synthetic datasets have been conducted to validate theorems and show the potential for using the model intervention effect for model interpretation."

    "abstract": "Abstract Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a type of blood cancer with diverse genetic variations and DNA methylation alterations. By studying the interaction of gene mutations, expression, and DNA methylation, we aimed to gain valuable insights into the processes that lead to block differentiation in AML. We analyzed TCGA-LAML data (173 samples) with RNA sequencing and DNA methylation arrays, comparing FLT3 mutant (48) and wild-type (125) cases. We conducted differential gene expression analysis using cBioPortal, identified DNA methylation differences with ChAMP tool, and correlated them with gene expression changes. Gene set enrichment analysis (g:Profiler) revealed significant biological processes and pathways. ShinyGo and GeneCards were used to find potential transcription factors and their binding sites among significant genes. We found significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) negatively correlated with their most significant methylation probes (Pearson correlation coefficient of −0.49, P-value <0.001) between FLT3 mutant and wild-type groups. Moreover, our exploration of 450 k CpG sites uncovered a global hypo-methylated status in 168 DEGs. Notably, these methylation changes were enriched in the promoter regions of Homebox superfamily gene, which are crucial in transcriptional-regulating pathways in blood cancer. Furthermore, in FLT3 mutant AML patient samples, we observed overexpress of WT1, a transcription factor known to bind homeobox gene family. This finding suggests a potential mechanism by which WT1 recruits TET2 to demethylate specific genomic regions. Integrating gene expression and DNA methylation analyses shed light on the impact of FLT3 mutations on cancer cell development and differentiation, supporting a two-hit model in AML. This research advances understanding of AML and fosters targeted therapeutic strategy development."

    "abstract": "Global Climate Models (GCMs) are crucial for predicting future climate changes by simulating the Earth systems. However, GCM outputs exhibit systematic biases due to model uncertainties, parameterization simplifications, and inadequate representation of complex climate phenomena. Traditional bias correction methods, which rely on historical observation data and statistical techniques, often neglect unobserved confounders, leading to biased results. This paper proposes a novel bias correction approach to utilize both GCM and observational data to learn a factor model that captures multi-cause latent confounders. Inspired by recent advances in causality based time series deconfounding, our method first constructs a factor model to learn latent confounders from historical data and then applies them to enhance the bias correction process using advanced time series forecasting models. The experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in the accuracy of precipitation outputs. By addressing unobserved confounders, our approach offers a robust and theoretically grounded solution for climate model bias correction."

    "abstract": "One of the fundamental challenges in causal inference is to estimate the causal effect of a treatment on its outcome of interest from observational data. However, causal effect estimation often suffers from the impacts of confounding bias caused by unmeasured confounders that affect both the treatment and the outcome. The instrumental variable (IV) approach is a powerful way to eliminate the confounding bias from latent confounders. However, the existing IV-based estimators require a nominated IV, and for a conditional IV (CIV) the corresponding conditioning set too, for causal effect estimation. This limits the application of IV-based estimators. In this paper, by leveraging the advantage of disentangled representation learning, we propose a novel method, named DVAE.CIV, for learning and disentangling the representations of CIV and the representations of its conditioning set for causal effect estimations from data with latent confounders. Extensive experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed DVAE.CIV method against the existing causal effect estimators."

    "abstract": "This paper studies the challenging problem of estimating causal effects from observational data, in the presence of unobserved confounders. The two-stage least square (TSLS) method and its variants with a standard instrumental variable (IV) are commonly used to eliminate confounding bias, including the bias caused by unobserved confounders, but they rely on the linearity assumption. Besides, the strict condition of unconfounded instruments posed on a standard IV is too strong to be practical. To address these challenging and practical problems of the standard IV method (linearity assumption and the strict condition), in this paper, we use a conditional IV (CIV) to relax the unconfounded instrument condition of standard IV and propose a non-linear CIV regression with Confounding Balancing Representation Learning, CBRL.CIV, for jointly eliminating the confounding bias from unobserved confounders and balancing the observed confounders, without the linearity assumption. We theoretically demonstrate the soundness of CBRL.CIV. Extensive experiments on synthetic and two real-world datasets show the competitive performance of CBRL.CIV against state-of-the-art IV-based estimators and superiority in dealing with the non-linear situation."

    "abstract": "Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) act as important modulators of gene expression and they have been confirmed to play critical roles in the physiology and development of malignant tumors. Understanding the synergism of multiple ncRNAs in competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) regulation can provide important insights into the mechanisms of malignant tumors caused by ncRNA regulation. In this work, we present a framework, SCOM, for identifying ncRNA synergistic competition. We systematically construct the landscape of ncRNA synergistic competition across 31 malignant tumors, and reveal that malignant tumors tend to share hub ncRNAs rather than the ncRNA interactions involved in the synergistic competition. In addition, the synergistic competition ncRNAs (i.e. ncRNAs involved in the synergistic competition) are likely to be involved in drug resistance, contribute to distinguishing molecular subtypes of malignant tumors, and participate in immune regulation. Furthermore, SCOM can help to infer ncRNA synergistic competition across malignant tumors and uncover potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers of malignant tumors. Altogether, the SCOM framework and the resulting web-based database SCOMdb (www.comblab.cn/SCOMdb/) serve as a useful resource for exploring ncRNA regulation and to accelerate the identification of carcinogenic biomarkers. Author summary Abundant evidence reveals that ncRNAs are important modulators of gene expression, and it is important for us to understand the regulation of ncRNAs in malignant tumors. In this work, we hypothesize that ncRNAs acting as ceRNAs can crosstalk with each other in the form of synergistic competition. We name the hypothesis as the ncRNA synergistic competition hypothesis. To uncover potential carcinogenic biomarkers, we present a framework, SCOM, for identifying ncRNA synergistic competition in malignant tumors. From the perspective of synergistic competition, we have shown that the synergistic competition ncRNAs are likely to involve in drug resistance, contribute to distinguishing molecular subtypes of malignant tumors, and participate in immune regulation. In addition, the synergistic competition ncRNAs are potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers of malignant tumors. We believe that the proposed framework SCOM and the web-based database SCOMdb can contribute to the design of reliable diagnosis and treatment biomarkers for malignant tumors."

    "abstract": "In Disability Employment Services (DES), an emerging problem is to make job survival analysis stable in unseen environments without prior knowledge of these environments. Existing survival analysis methods cannot adequately solve this problem since they assume that distribution of unseen data is similar to that observed during training. However, this assumption can be violated in practice where unanticipated events such as COVID19 and inflation can change the work and life patterns of people with disability. Models trained before the COVID19 pandemic may make unreliable job survival predictions in COVID19 or inflation situations. It is also costly and time consuming to frequently re-train and deploy the models. This paper proposes a stable survival analysis method for the DES sector without requiring prior knowledge of deployment environments. Latent representations are learned to capture non-linear relationships between relevant features and job survival time. Two reweighting stages are developed to remove censoring and conditional spurious correlations between irrelevant features and the survival outcome. The case study of Australian workers with disability shows that our method can make stable risk predictions. It can also help workers with disability determine the most effective skills for improvement to increase their job survival time. Further evaluations with public datasets show the promising stable performance of our method in other applications."

    "abstract": "RNA-sequencing technology provides an effective tool for understanding miRNA regulation in complex human diseases, including cancers. A large number of computational methods have been developed to make use of bulk and single-cell RNA-sequencing data to identify miRNA regulations at the resolution of multiple samples (i.e. group of cells or tissues). However, due to the heterogeneity of individual samples, there is a strong need to infer miRNA regulation specific to individual samples to uncover miRNA regulation at single-sample resolution level. Here, we develop a framework, Scan, for scanning sample-specific miRNA regulation. Since a single network inference method or strategy cannot perform well for all types of new data, Scan incorporates 27 network inference methods and two strategies to infer tissue-specific or cell-specific miRNA regulation from bulk or single-cell RNA-sequencing data. Results on bulk and single-cell RNA-sequencing data demonstrate the effectiveness of Scan in inferring sample-specific miRNA regulation. Moreover, we have found that incorporating priori information of miRNA targets can improve the accuracy of miRNA target prediction. In addition, Scan can contribute to the clustering cells/tissues and construction of cell/tissue correlation networks. Finally, the comparison results have shown that the performance of network inference methods is likely to be data-specific, and selecting optimal network inference methods is required for more accurate prediction of miRNA targets. We have made Scan freely available to the public to help infer sample-specific miRNA regulation for new data, benchmark new network inference methods and deepen the understanding of miRNA regulation at the resolution of individual samples."

    "abstract": "Researchers have developed various visualization techniques, such as attribution maps, to understand which parts of an input contribute most to a model’s decision. However, existing methods often produce disparate results and may lack human-perceptual interpretability. In this work, we propose Relevance-IBA, a novel approach that combines the strengths of Information Bottleneck Attribution (IBA) and Layer-wise Relevance Propagation’s (LRP) method to estimate more accurate and human-perceptually interpretable attribution maps. Our method accentuates the contours and subtle details of the identified object, making the model’s decisions more intuitively understandable. Additionally, we introduce a segmentation-oriented evaluation technique, which assesses the capacity of interpretability methods by emphasizing the most important pixels within an object’s boundaries. We benchmark Relevance-IBA against various methodologies, including DeepLIFT, Integrated Gradients, Guided-BP, Guided-GradCAM, IBA, and InputIBA. Our results indicate that Relevance-IBA not only boosts attribution accuracy but also prioritizes human-perceptual clarity, making it a valuable tool for interpreting complex model behaviors."

    "abstract": "A predictive model makes outcome predictions based on some given features, i.e., it estimates the conditional probability of the outcome given a feature vector. In general, a predictive model cannot estimate the causal effect of a feature on the outcome, i.e., how the outcome will change if the feature is changed while keeping the values of other features unchanged. This is because causal effect estimation requires interventional probabilities. However, many real world problems such as personalised decision making, recommendation, and fairness computing, need to know the causal effect of any feature on the outcome for a given instance. This is different from the traditional causal effect estimation problem with a fixed treatment variable. This paper first tackles the challenge of estimating the causal effect of any feature (as the treatment) on the outcome w.r.t. a given instance. The theoretical results naturally link a predictive model to causal effect estimations and imply that a predictive model is causally interpretable when the conditions identified in the paper are satisfied. The paper also reveals the robust property of a causally interpretable model. We use experiments to demonstrate that various types of predictive models, when satisfying the conditions identified in this paper, can estimate the causal effects of features as accurately as state-of-the-art causal effect estimation methods. We also show the potential of such causally interpretable predictive models for robust predictions and personalised decision making."

    "abstract": "Causal inference from longitudinal observational data is a challenging problem due to the difficulty in correctly identifying the time-dependent confounders, especially in the presence of latent time-dependent confounders. Instrumental variable (IV) is a powerful tool for addressing the latent confounders issue, but the traditional IV technique cannot deal with latent time-dependent confounders in longitudinal studies. In this work, we propose a novel Time-dependent Instrumental Factor Model (TIFM) for time-varying causal effect estimation from data with latent time-dependent confounders. At each time-step, the proposed TIFM method employs the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture to infer latent IV, and then uses the inferred latent IV factor for addressing the confounding bias caused by the latent time-dependent confounders. We provide a theoretical analysis for the proposed TIFM method regarding causal effect estimation in longitudinal data. Extensive evaluation with synthetic datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of TIFM in addressing causal effect estimation over time. We further apply TIFM to a climate dataset to showcase the potential of the proposed method in tackling real-world problems."

This problem requires causal reasoning to estimate the individual causal effect of possible factors on the outcome to determine the most effective intervention. In this paper, we propose a causal graph based framework to solve the intervention recommendation problem for survival outcome (job retention time) and non-survival outcome (employment status). For an individual, a personalized causal graph is predicted for them. It indicates which factors affect the outcome and their causal effects at different intervention levels. Based on the causal graph, we can determine the most effective intervention for an individual, i.e., the one that can generate a maximum outcome increase. Experiments with two case studies show that our framework can help people with disability increase their employment success. Evaluations with public datasets also show the advantage of our framework in other applications."

    "abstract": "Causal relationships have been utilized in almost all disciplines, and the research into causal discovery has attracted a lot of attention in the last few years. Traditionally, causal relationships are identified by making use of interventions or randomized controlled experiments. However, conducting such experiments is often expensive or even impossible due to cost or ethical concerns. Therefore, there has been an increasing interest in discovering causal relationships based on observational data, and in the past few decades, significant contributions have been made to this field by computer scientists. Following the success of CD 2016 - CD 2021, CDPD 2023 continues to serve as a forum for researchers and practitioners in data mining and other disciplines to share their recent research in causal discovery in their respective fields and to explore the possibility of interdisciplinary collaborations in the study of causality. Based on the platform of KDD, this workshop is especially interested in attracting contributions that link data mining/machine learning research with causal discovery, and solutions to causal discovery in large scale datasets."

    "abstract": "In Disability Employment Services (DES), an emerging problem is recommending to disabled workers the right skill to upgrade and the right upgrade level to achieve a maximum increase in their job retention time. This problem involves causal reasoning to estimate the individual causal effect (ICE) on the survival outcome, i.e., job retention time, to determine the most effective intervention for a worker. Existing methods are not suitable to solve our problem. They are mostly developed for non-causal or non-survival challenges, while methods for causal survival analysis are under-explored. This paper proposes a representation learning method for recommending personalized interventions that can generate a maximum increase in job retention time for workers with disability. In our method, observed covariates are disentangled into latent variables based on which confounding and censoring biases are eliminated, and the ICE prediction model is built. Since true ICE values are not directly measurable in observational data, a reverse engineering technique is developed to estimate ICE for training samples. These estimated ICE values are then used as the pseudo ground truth to train the prediction model. Experiments with a case study of Australian workers with disability show that by adopting personalized interventions recommended by our method, disabled workers can increase their job retention time by up to 2.8 months. Additional evaluations with public datasets also show the technical strengths of our method in other applications."

    "abstract": "The instrumental variable (IV) approach is a widely used way to estimate the causal effects of a treatment on an outcome of interest from observational data with latent confounders. A standard IV is expected to be related to the treatment variable and independent of all other variables in the system. However, it is challenging to search for a standard IV from data directly due to the strict conditions. The conditional IV (CIV) method has been proposed to allow a variable to be an instrument conditioning on a set of variables, allowing a wider choice of possible IVs and enabling broader practical applications of the IV approach. Nevertheless, there is not a data-driven method to discover a CIV and its conditioning set directly from data. To fill this gap, in this paper, we propose to learn the representations of the information of a CIV and its conditioning set from data with latent confounders for average causal effect estimation. By taking advantage of deep generative models, we develop a novel data-driven approach for simultaneously learning the representation of a CIV from measured variables and generating the representation of its conditioning set given measured variables. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that our method outperforms the existing IV methods."

    "abstract": "Causal relationships have been utilized in almost all disciplines, and the research into causal discovery has attracted a lot of attention in the last few years. Traditionally, causal relationships are identified by making use of interventions or randomized controlled experiments. However, conducting such experiments is often expensive or even impossible due to cost or ethical concerns. Therefore, there has been an increasing interest in discovering causal relationships based on observational data, and in the past few decades, significant contributions have been made to this field by computer scientists. Following the success of CD 2016 - CD 2021, CD 2022 continues to serve as a forum for researchers and practitioners in data mining and other disciplines to share their recent research in causal discovery in their respective fields and to explore the possibility of interdisciplinary collaborations in the study of causality. Based on the platform of KDD, this workshop is especially interested in attracting contributions that link data mining/machine learning research with causal discovery, and solutions to causal discovery in large scale datasets."

    "abstract": "This paper studies the problem of estimating the contributions of features to the prediction of a speciﬁc instance by a machine learning model and the overall contribution of a feature to the model. The causal effect of a feature (variable) on the predicted outcome reﬂects the contribution of the feature to a prediction very well. A challenge is that most existing causal effects cannot be estimated from data without a known causal graph. In this paper, we deﬁne an explanatory causal effect based on a hypothetical ideal experiment. The deﬁnition brings several beneﬁts to model agnostic explanations. First, explanations are transparent and have causal meanings. Second, the explanatory causal effect estimation can be data driven. Third, the causal effects provide both a local explanation for a speciﬁc prediction and a global explanation showing the overall importance of a feature in a predictive model. We further propose a method using individual and combined variables based on explanatory causal effects for explanations. We show the deﬁnition and the method work with experiments on some real-world data sets."

    "abstract": "Abstract Summary MicroRNA (miRNA) sponges influence the capability of miRNA-mediated gene silencing by competing for shared miRNA response elements and play significant roles in many physiological and pathological processes. It has been proved that computational or dry-lab approaches are useful to guide wet-lab experiments for uncovering miRNA sponge regulation. However, all of the existing tools only allow the analysis of miRNA sponge regulation regarding a group of samples, rather than the miRNA sponge regulation unique to individual samples. Furthermore, most existing tools do not allow parallel computing for the fast identification of miRNA sponge regulation. Here, we present an enhanced version of our R/Bioconductor package, miRspongeR 2.0. Compared with the original version introduced in 2019, this package extends the resolution of miRNA sponge regulation from the multi-sample level to the single-sample level. Moreover, it supports the identification of miRNA sponge networks using parallel computing, and the construction of sample–sample correlation networks. It also provides more computational methods to infer miRNA sponge regulation and expands the ground truth for validation. With these new features, we anticipate that miRspongeR 2.0 will further accelerate the research on miRNA sponges with higher resolution and more utilities.

    "abstract": "Unobserved confounding is the main obstacle to causal effect estimation from observational data. Instrumental variables (IVs) are widely used for causal effect estimation when there exist latent confounders. With the standard IV method, when a given IV is valid, unbiased estimation can be obtained, but the validity requirement on a standard IV is strict and untestable. Conditional IVs have been proposed to relax the requirement of standard IVs by conditioning on a set of observed variables (known as a conditioning set for a conditional IV). However, the criterion for finding a conditioning set for a conditional IV needs a directed acyclic graph (DAG) representing the causal relationships of both observed and unobserved variables. This makes it challenging to discover a conditioning set directly from data. In this paper, by leveraging maximal ancestral graphs (MAGs) for causal inference with latent variables, we study the graphical properties of ancestral IVs, a type of conditional IVs using MAGs, and develop the theory to support data-driven discovery of the conditioning set for a given ancestral IV in data under the pretreatment variable assumption. Based on the theory, we develop an algorithm for unbiased causal effect estimation with a given ancestral IV and observational data. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the performance of the algorithm in comparison with existing IV methods."

    "abstract": "In many fields of scientific research and real-world applications, unbiased estimation of causal effects from non-experimental data is crucial for understanding the mechanism underlying the data and for decision-making on effective responses or interventions. A great deal of research has been conducted to address this challenging problem from different angles. For estimating causal effect in observational data, assumptions such as Markov condition, faithfulness, and causal sufficiency are always made. Under the assumptions, full knowledge, such as a set of covariates or an underlying causal graph, is typically required. A practical challenge is that in many applications, no such full knowledge or only some partial knowledge is available. In recent years, research has emerged to use search strategies based on graphical causal modelling to discover useful knowledge from data for causal effect estimation, with some mild assumptions, and has shown promise in tackling the practical challenge. In this survey, we review these data-driven methods on causal effect estimation for a single treatment with a single outcome of interest and focus on the challenges faced by data-driven causal effect estimation. We concisely summarise the basic concepts and theories that are essential for data-driven causal effect estimation using graphical causal modelling but are scattered around the literature. We identify and discuss the challenges faced by data-driven causal effect estimation and characterise the existing methods by their assumptions and the approaches to tackling the challenges. We analyse the strengths and limitations of the different types of methods and present an empirical evaluation to support the discussions. We hope this review will motivate more researchers to design better data-driven methods based on graphical causal modelling for the challenging problem of causal effect estimation."

    "abstract": "Abstract Preeclampsia is a pregnancy-specific disease that can have serious effects on the health of both mothers and their offspring. Predicting which women will develop preeclampsia in early pregnancy with high accuracy will allow for improved management. The clinical symptoms of preeclampsia are well recognized, however, the precise molecular mechanisms leading to the disorder are poorly understood. This is compounded by the heterogeneous nature of preeclampsia onset, timing and severity. Indeed a multitude of poorly defined causes including genetic components implicates etiologic factors, such as immune maladaptation, placental ischemia and increased oxidative stress. Large datasets generated by microarray and next-generation sequencing have enabled the comprehensive study of preeclampsia at the molecular level. However, computational approaches to simultaneously analyze the preeclampsia transcriptomic and network data and identify clinically relevant information are currently limited. In this paper, we proposed a control theory method to identify potential preeclampsia-associated genes based on both transcriptomic and network data. First, we built a preeclampsia gene regulatory network and analyzed its controllability. We then defined two types of critical preeclampsia-associated genes that play important roles in the constructed preeclampsia-specific network. Benchmarking against differential expression, betweenness centrality and hub analysis we demonstrated that the proposed method may offer novel insights compared with other standard approaches. Next, we investigated subtype specific genes for early and late onset preeclampsia. This control theory approach could contribute to a further understanding of the molecular mechanisms contributing to preeclampsia."

    "abstract": "As a basic and effective tool for explanation, prediction and decision making, causal relationships have been utilized in almost all disciplines. Traditionally, causal relationships are identified by making use of interventions or randomized controlled experiments. However, conducting such experiments is often expensive or even impossible due to cost or ethical concerns. Therefore, there has been an increasing interest in discovering causal relationships based on observational data, and in the past few decades, significant contributions have been made to this field by computer scientists. Inspired by such achievements and following the success of CD 2016 - CD 2020, CD 2021 continues to serve as a forum for researchers and practitioners in data mining and other disciplines to share their recent research in causal discovery in their respective fields and to explore the possibility of interdisciplinary collaborations in the study of causality. Based on the platform of KDD, this workshop is especially interested in attracting contributions that link data mining/machine learning research with causal discovery, and solutions to causal discovery in large-scale datasets."

    "abstract": "MOTIVATION\nIdentifying meaningful cancer driver genes in a cohort of tumors is a challenging task in cancer genomics. Although existing studies have identified known cancer drivers, most of them focus on detecting coding drivers with mutations. It is acknowledged that non-coding drivers can regulate driver mutations to promote cancer growth. In this work, we propose a novel node importance based network analysis (NIBNA) framework to detect coding and non-coding cancer drivers. We hypothesize that cancer drivers are crucial to the formation of community structures in cancer network, and removing them from the network greatly perturbs the network structure thereby critically affecting the functioning of the network. NIBNA detects cancer drivers using a three-step process; first, a condition-specific network is built by incorporating gene expression data and gene networks, second, the community structures in the network are estimated and third, a centrality-based metric is applied to compute node importance.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe apply NIBNA to the BRCA dataset and it outperforms existing state-of-art methods in detecting coding cancer drivers. NIBNA also predicts 265 miRNA drivers and majority of these drivers have been validated in literature. Further we apply NIBNA to detect cancer subtype-specific drivers and several predicted drivers have been validated to be associated with cancer subtypes. Lastly, we evaluate NIBNA's performance in detecting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) drivers, and we confirmed 8 coding and 13 miRNA drivers in the list of known genes.\n\n\nAVAILABILITY\nThe source code can be accessed at: https://github.com/mandarsc/NIBNA.\n\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION\nSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online."

    "abstract": "In Disability Employment Services (DES), a growing problem is recommending to disabled job seekers which skill should be upgraded and the best level for upgrading this skill to increase their employment potential most. This problem involves counterfactual reasoning to infer causal effect of factors on employment status to recommend the most effective intervention. Related methods cannot solve our problem adequately since they are developed for non-counterfactual challenges, for binary causal factors, or for randomized trials. In this paper, we present a causality-based method to tackle the problem. The method includes two stages where causal factors of employment status are first detected from data. We then combine a counterfactual reasoning framework with a machine learning approach to build an interpretable model for generating personalized recommendations. Experiments on both synthetic datasets and a real case study from a DES provider show consistent promising performance of improving employability of disabled job seekers. Results from the case study disclose effective factors and their best levels for intervention to increase employability. The most effective intervention varies among job seekers. Our model can separate job seekers by degree of employability increase. This is helpful for DES providers to allocate resources for employment assistance. Moreover, causal interpretability makes our recommendations actionable in DES business practice."

    "abstract": "Predicting breast cancer prognosis helps improve the treatment and management of the disease. In the last decades, many prediction models have been developed for breast cancer prognosis based on transcriptomic data. A common assumption made by these models is that the test and training data follow the same distribution. However, in practice, due to the heterogeneity of breast cancer and the different environments (e.g. hospitals) where data are collected, the distribution of the test data may shift from that of the training data. For example, new patients likely have different breast cancer stage distribution from those in the training dataset. Thus these existing methods may not provide stable prediction performance for breast cancer prognosis in situations with the shift of data distribution. In this paper, we present a novel stable prediction method for reliable breast cancer prognosis under data distribution shift. Our model, known as Deep Global Balancing Cox regression (DGBCox), is based on the causal inference theory. In DGBCox, firstly high-dimensional gene expression data is transferred to latent network-based representations by a deep auto-encoder neural network. Then after balancing the latent representations using a proposed causality-based approach, causal latent features are selected for breast cancer prognosis. Causal features have persistent relationships with survival outcomes even under distribution shift across different environments according to the causal inference theory. Therefore, the proposed DGBCox method is robust and stable for breast cancer prognosis. We apply DGBCox to 12 test datasets from different breast cancer studies. The results show that DGBCox outperforms benchmark methods in terms of both prediction accuracy and stability. We also propose a permutation importance algorithm to rank the genes in the DGBCox model. The top 50 ranked genes suggest that the cell cycle and the organelle organisation could be the most relevant biological processes for stable breast cancer prognosis. Author summary Various prediction models have been proposed for breast cancer prognosis. The prediction models usually train on a dataset and predict the survival outcomes of patients in new test datasets. The majority of these models share a common assumption that the test and training data follow the same distribution. However, as breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease, the assumption may be violated in practice. In this study, we propose a novel method for reliable breast cancer prognosis when the test data distribution shifts from that of the training data. The proposed model has been trained on one dataset and applied to twelve test datasets from different breast cancer studies. In comparison with the benchmark methods in breast cancer prognosis, our model shows better prediction accuracy and stability. The top 50 important genes in our model provide clues to the relationship between several biological mechanisms and clinical outcomes of breast cancer. Our proposed method in breast cancer can potentially be adapted to apply to other cancer types."

    "abstract": "With the widespread use of learning analytics (LA), ethical concerns about fairness havebeen raised. Research shows that LA models may be biased against students of certaindemographic groups. Although fairness has gained significant attention in the broadermachine learning (ML) community in the last decade, it is only recently that attentionhas been paid to fairness in LA. Furthermore, the decision on which unfairness mitigationalgorithm or metric to use in a particular context remains largely unknown. On thispremise, we performed a comparative evaluation of some selected unfairness mitigationalgorithms regarded in the fair ML community to have shown promising results. Using a3-year program dropout data from an Australian university, we comparatively evaluatedhow the unfairness mitigation algorithms contribute to ethical LA by testing for somehypotheses across fairness and performance metrics. Interestingly, our results show howdata bias does not always necessarily result in predictive bias. Perhaps not surprisingly,our test for fairness-utility tradeoff shows how ensuring fairness does not always lead todrop in utility. Indeed, our results show that ensuring fairness might lead to enhanced utilityunder specific circumstance. Our findings may to some extent, guide fairness algorithmand metric selection for a given context."

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT In molecular biology, microRNA (miRNA) sponges are RNA transcripts which compete with other RNA transcripts for binding with miRNAs. Research has shown that miRNA sponges have a fundamental impact on tissue development and disease progression. Generally, to achieve a specific biological function, miRNA sponges tend to form modules or communities in a biological system. Until now, however, there is still a lack of tools to aid researchers to infer and analyse miRNA sponge modules from heterogeneous data. To fill this gap, we develop an R/Bioconductor package, miRSM, for facilitating the procedure of inferring and analysing miRNA sponge modules. miRSM provides a collection of 50 co-expression analysis methods to identify gene co-expression modules (which are candidate miRNA sponge modules), four module discovery methods to infer miRNA sponge modules and seven modular analysis methods for investigating miRNA sponge modules. miRSM will enable researchers to quickly apply new datasets to infer and analyse miRNA sponge modules, and will consequently accelerate the research on miRNA sponges."

    "abstract": "Inferring competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) or microRNA (miRNA) sponge modules is a challenging and meaningful task for revealing ceRNA regulation mechanism at the module level. Modules in this context refer to groups of miRNA sponges which have mutual competitions and act as functional units for achieving biological processes. The recent development of computational methods based on heterogeneous data provides a novel way to discern the competitive effects of miRNA sponges on human complex diseases. This article aims to provide a comprehensive perspective of miRNA sponge module discovery methods. We first review the publicly available databases of cancer‐related miRNA sponges, as the miRNA sponges involved in human cancers contribute to the discovery of cancer‐associated modules. Then we review the existing computational methods for inferring miRNA sponge modules. Furthermore, we conduct an assessment on the performance of the module discovery methods with the pan‐cancer dataset, and the comparison study indicates that it is useful to infer biologically meaningful miRNA sponge modules by directly mapping heterogeneous data to the competitive modules. Finally, we discuss the future directions and associated challenges in developing in silico methods to infer miRNA sponge modules."

    "abstract": "Accurate prognosis and identification of cancer subtypes at molecular level are important steps towards effective and personalised treatments of breast cancer. To this end, many computational methods have been developed to use gene (mRNA) expression data for breast cancer subtyping and prognosis. Meanwhile, microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been extensively studied in the last 2 decades and their associations with breast cancer subtypes and prognosis have been evidenced. However, it is not clear whether using miRNA and/or lncRNA expression data helps improve the performance of gene expression based subtyping and prognosis methods, and this raises challenges as to how and when to use these data and methods in practice. In this paper, we conduct a comparative study of 35 methods, including 12 breast cancer subtyping methods and 23 breast cancer prognosis methods, on a collection of 19 independent breast cancer datasets. We aim to uncover the roles of miRNAs and lncRNAs in breast cancer subtyping and prognosis from the systematic comparison. In addition, we created an R package, CancerSubtypesPrognosis, including all the 35 methods to facilitate the reproducibility of the methods and streamline the evaluation. The experimental results show that integrating miRNA expression data helps improve the performance of the mRNA-based cancer subtyping methods. However, miRNA signatures are not as good as mRNA signatures for breast cancer prognosis. In general, lncRNA expression data does not help improve the mRNA-based methods in both cancer subtyping and cancer prognosis. These results suggest that the prognostic roles of miRNA/lncRNA signatures in the improvement of breast cancer prognosis needs to be further verified."

    "abstract": "The classification of clinical samples based on gene expression data is an important part of precision medicine. In this manuscript, we show how transforming gene expression data into a set of personalized (sample-specific) networks can allow us to harness existing graph-based methods to improve classifier performance. Existing approaches to personalized gene networks have the limitation that they depend on other samples in the data and must get re-computed whenever a new sample is introduced. Here, we propose a novel method, called Personalized Annotation-based Networks (PAN), that avoids this limitation by using curated annotation databases to transform gene expression data into a graph. Unlike competing methods, PANs are calculated for each sample independent of the population, making it a more efficient way to obtain single-sample networks. Using three breast cancer datasets as a case study, we show that PAN classifiers not only predict cancer relapse better than gene features alone, but also outperform PPI (protein-protein interactions) and population-level graph-based classifiers. This work demonstrates the practical advantages of graph-based classification for high-dimensional genomic data, while offering a new approach to making sample-specific networks. Supplementary information: PAN and the baselines are implemented in Python. Source code and data are available at https://github.com/thinng/PAN."

In this paper, we propose an adversary detection method, TAPD, which divides and conquers adversary detection through utilizing dependency-based and proximity-based anomaly detection techniques. We innovatively use logits to categorize adversarial examples so that the knowledge of adversary generation is captured in the generated categories. Based on the characteristics of categories, two kNN distance-based detectors are proposed, and one existing dependency-based detector is selected to effectively detect adversarial examples in their corresponding category. Extensive experiments have been conducted, and the results have shown that TAPD outperforms the state-of-the-art adversary detection methods."

Accordingly, multiple computational tools have been developed to facilitate this task. Due to the different methods employed by these tools, different data considered by the tools, and the rapidly evolving nature of the field, the selection of an appropriate tool for cancer driver discovery is not straightforward. This survey seeks to provide a comprehensive review of the different computational methods for discovering cancer drivers. We categorise the methods into three groups; methods for single driver identification, methods for driver module identification, and methods for identifying personalised cancer drivers. In addition to providing a “one-stop” reference of these methods, by evaluating and comparing their performance, we also provide readers the information about the different capabilities of the methods in identifying biologically significant cancer drivers. The biologically relevant information identified by these tools can be seen through the enrichment of discovered cancer drivers in GO biological processes and KEGG pathways and through our identification of a small cancer-driver cohort that is capable of stratifying patient survival."

    "abstract": "We describe and provide an array of diverse methods to predict cellular positions in tissue from RNA-seq data selecting mapping genes according to their spatial/statistical properties and their effect on improving the cell positioning. Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNAseq) technologies are rapidly evolving. Although very informative, in standard scRNAseq experiments, the spatial organization of the cells in the tissue of origin is lost. Conversely, spatial RNA-seq technologies designed to maintain cell localization have limited throughput and gene coverage. Mapping scRNAseq to genes with spatial information increases coverage while providing spatial location. However, methods to perform such mapping have not yet been benchmarked. To fill this gap, we organized the DREAM Single-Cell Transcriptomics challenge focused on the spatial reconstruction of cells from the Drosophila embryo from scRNAseq data, leveraging as silver standard, genes with in situ hybridization data from the Berkeley Drosophila Transcription Network Project reference atlas. The 34 participating teams used diverse algorithms for gene selection and location prediction, while being able to correctly localize clusters of cells. Selection of predictor genes was essential for this task. Predictor genes showed a relatively high expression entropy, high spatial clustering and included prominent developmental genes such as gap and pair-rule genes and tissue markers. Application of the top 10 methods to a zebra fish embryo dataset yielded similar performance and statistical properties of the selected genes than in the Drosophila data. This suggests that methods developed in this challenge are able to extract generalizable properties of genes that are useful to accurately reconstruct the spatial arrangement of cells in tissues."

    "abstract": "Existing computational methods for studying miRNA regulation are mostly based on bulk miRNA and mRNA expression data. However, bulk data only allows the analysis of miRNA regulation regarding a group of cells, rather than the miRNA regulation unique to individual cells. Recent advance in single-cell miRNA-mRNA co-sequencing technology has opened a way for investigating miRNA regulation at single-cell level. However, as currently single-cell miRNA-mRNA co-sequencing data is just emerging and only available at small-scale, there is a strong need of novel methods to exploit existing single-cell data for the study of cell-specific miRNA regulation. In this work, we propose a new method, CSmiR (Cell-Specific miRNA regulation) to combine single-cell miRNA-mRNA co-sequencing data and putative miRNA-mRNA binding information to identify miRNA regulatory networks at the resolution of individual cells. We apply CSmiR to the miRNA-mRNA co-sequencing data in 19 K562 single-cells to identify cell-specific miRNA-mRNA regulatory networks for understanding miRNA regulation in each K562 single-cell. By analyzing the obtained cell-specific miRNA-mRNA regulatory networks, we observe that the miRNA regulation in each K562 single-cell is unique. Moreover, we conduct detailed analysis on the cell-specific miRNA regulation associated with the miR-17/92 family as a case study. The comparison results indicate that CSmiR is effective in predicting cell-specific miRNA targets. Finally, through exploring cell–cell similarity matrix characterized by cell-specific miRNA regulation, CSmiR provides a novel strategy for clustering single-cells and helps to understand cell–cell crosstalk. To the best of our knowledge, CSmiR is the first method to explore miRNA regulation at a single-cell resolution level, and we believe that it can be a useful method to enhance the understanding of cell-specific miRNA regulation."

    "abstract": "Causal effect estimation from observational data is a crucial but challenging task. Currently, only a limited number of data-driven causal effect estimation methods are available. These methods either only provide a bound estimation of the causal effect of a treatment on the outcome, or have impractical assumptions on the data or low efficiency although providing a unique estimation of the causal effect. In this paper, we identify a practical problem setting and propose an approach to achieving unique causal effect estimation from data with hidden variables under this setting. For the approach, we develop the theorems to support the discovery of the proper covariate sets for confounding adjustment (adjustment sets). Based on the theorems, two algorithms are presented for finding the proper adjustment sets from data with hidden variables to obtain unbiased and unique causal effect estimation. Experiments with benchmark Bayesian networks and real-world datasets have demonstrated the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, indicating the practicability of the identified problem setting and the potential of the approach in real-world applications."

    "abstract": "In the disability employment service, an emerging challenge is to recommend the skills whose improvement will increase the employment perspective most. The process of a skill being improved is called an intervention and different skills are called factors. The problem involves recommendation for outcome improvement, which requires estimating the improvement in the employment perspective, i.e., the outcome, driven by interventions on recommended factors. Currently, most recommendation systems deployed for the employment service rely on traditional recommendation models where the desired outcome instead of the degree of outcome improvement is the main goal for optimization. In this paper, we present a causality-based approach for recommending factors for intervention to achieve the largest improvement in the employment potential of disabled job seekers. It involves inferring the causal effect of interventions on the employment outcome to make recommendations for individuals. The causal interpretation of our model can justify given recommendations. We conduct a case study with our industry partner in the disability employment service. Results show that the recommended interventions could improve the employability of disabled job seekers. Experiments are also carried out with datasets in other domains to demonstrate the promise of our approach in different applications."

    "abstract": "Causal feature selection has attracted much attention in recent years, as the causal features selected imply the causal mechanism related to the class attribute, leading to more reliable prediction models built using them. Currently there is a need of developing multi-source feature selection methods, since in many applications data for studying the same problem has been collected from various sources, such as multiple gene expression datasets obtained from different experiments for studying the causes of the same disease. However, the state-of-the-art causal feature selection methods generally tackle a single dataset, and a direct application of the methods to multiple datasets will result in unreliable results as the datasets may have different distributions. To address the challenges, by utilizing the concept of causal invariance in causal inference, we first formulate the problem of causal feature selection with multiple datasets as a search problem for an invariant set across the datasets, then give the upper and lower bounds of the invariant set, and finally we propose a new Multi-source Causal Feature Selection algorithm, MCFS. Using synthetic and real world datasets and 16 feature selection methods, the extensive experiments have validated the effectiveness of MCFS."

    "abstract": "Causal effect estimation from observational data is a challenging problem, especially with high dimensional data and in the presence of unobserved variables. The available data-driven methods for tackling the problem either provide an estimation of the bounds of a causal effect (i.e., nonunique estimation) or have low efficiency. The major hurdle for achieving high efficiency while trying to obtain unique and unbiased causal effect estimation is how to find a proper adjustment set for confounding control in a fast way, given the huge covariate space and considering unobserved variables. In this paper, we approach the problem as a local search task for finding valid adjustment sets in data. We establish the theorems to support the local search for adjustment sets, and we show that unique and unbiased estimation can be achieved from observational data even when there exist unobserved variables. We then propose a data-driven algorithm that is fast and consistent under mild assumptions. We also make use of a frequent pattern mining method to further speed up the search of minimal adjustment sets for causal effect estimation. Experiments conducted on extensive synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art criteria/estimators in both accuracy and time-efficiency."

    "abstract": "Motivation Identifying cancer driver genes is a key task in cancer informatics. Most exisiting methods are focused on individual cancer drivers which regulate biological processes leading to cancer. However, the effect of a single gene may not be sufficient to drive cancer progression. Here, we hypothesise that there are driver gene groups that work in concert to regulate cancer and we develop a novel computational method to detect those driver gene groups. Results We develop a novel method named DriverGroup to detect driver gene groups by using gene expression and gene interaction data. The proposed method has three stages: (1) Constructing the gene network, (2) Discovering critical nodes of the constructed network, and (3) Identifying driver gene groups based on the discovered critical nodes. Before evaluating the performance of DriverGroup in detecting cancer driver groups, we firstly assess its performance in detecting the influence of gene groups, a key step of DriverGroup. The application of DriverGroup to DREAM4 data demonstrates that it is more effective than other methods in detecting the regulation of gene groups. We then apply DriverGroup to the BRCA dataset to identify coding and non-coding driver groups for breast cancer. The identified driver groups are promising as several group members are confirmed to be related to cancer in literature. We further use the predicted driver groups in survival analysis and the results show that the survival curves of patient subpopulations classified using the predicted driver groups are significantly differentiated, indicating the usefulness of DriverGroup.

    "abstract": "This paper discusses the problem of causal query in observational data with hidden variables, with the aim of seeking the change of an outcome when \"manipulating\" a variable while given a set of plausible confounding variables which affect the manipulated variable and the outcome. Such an \"experiment on data\" to estimate the causal effect of the manipulated variable is useful for validating an experiment design using historical data or for exploring confounders when studying a new relationship. However, existing data-driven methods for causal effect estimation face some major challenges, including poor scalability with high dimensional data, low estimation accuracy due to heuristics used by the global causal structure learning algorithms, and the assumption of causal sufficiency when hidden variables are inevitable in data. In this paper, we develop theorems for using local search to find a superset of the adjustment (or confounding) variables for causal effect estimation from observational data under a realistic pretreatment assumption. The theorems ensure that the unbiased estimate of causal effect is obtained in the set of causal effects estimated by the superset of adjustment variables. \nBased on the developed theorems, we propose a data-driven algorithm for causal query. Experiments show that the proposed algorithm is faster and produces better causal effect estimation than an existing data-driven causal effect estimation method with hidden variables. The causal effects estimated by the algorithm are as good as those by the state-of-the-art methods using domain knowledge."

    "abstract": "Dependency-based anomaly detection methods detect anomalies by looking at the deviations from the normal probabilistic dependency among variables and are able to discover more subtle and meaningful anomalies. However, with high dimensional data, they face two key challenges. One is how to find the right set of relevant variables for a given variable from the large search space to assess dependency deviation. The other is how to use the dependency to estimate the expected value of a variable accurately. In this paper, we propose the Local Prediction approach to Anomaly Detection (LoPAD) framework to deal with the two challenges simultaneously. Through introducing Markov Blanket into dependency-based anomaly detection, LoPAD decomposes the high dimensional unsupervised anomaly detection problem into local feature selection and prediction problems while achieving better performance and interpretability. The framework enables instantiations with off-the-shelf predictive models for anomaly detection. Comprehensive experiments have been done on both synthetic and real-world data. The results show that LoPAD outperforms state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods."

    "abstract": "Motivation microRNAs (miRNAs) are important gene regulators and they are involved in many biological processes, including cancer progression. Therefore, correctly identifying miRNA-mRNA interactions is a crucial task. To this end, a huge number of computational methods has been developed, but they mainly use the data at one snapshot and ignore the dynamics of a biological process. The recent development of single cell data and the booming of the exploration of cell trajectories using “pseudo-time” concept have inspired us to develop a pseudo-time based method to infer the miRNA-mRNA relationships characterising a biological process by taking into account the temporal aspect of the process. Results We have developed a novel approach, called pseudo-time causality (PTC), to find the causal relationships between miRNAs and mRNAs during a biological process. We have applied the proposed method to both single cell and bulk sequencing datasets for Epithelia to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT), a key process in cancer metastasis. The evaluation results show that our method significantly outperforms existing methods in finding miRNA-mRNA interactions in both single cell and bulk data. The results suggest that utilising the pseudo-temporal information from the data helps reveal the gene regulation in a biological process much better than using the static information.

    "abstract": "Motivation Unravelling cancer driver genes is important in cancer research. Although computational methods have been developed to identify cancer drivers, most of them detect cancer drivers at population level. However, two patients who have the same cancer type and receive the same treatment may have different outcomes because each patient has a different genome and their disease might be driven by different driver genes. Therefore new methods are being developed for discovering cancer drivers at individual level, but existing personalised methods only focus on coding drivers while microRNAs (miRNAs) have been shown to drive cancer progression as well. Thus, novel methods are required to discover both coding and miRNA cancer drivers at individual level. Results We propose the novel method, pDriver, to discover personalised cancer drivers. pDriver includes two stages: (1) Constructing gene networks for each cancer patient and (2) Discovering cancer drivers for each patient based on the constructed gene networks. To demonstrate the effectiveness of pDriver, we have applied it to five TCGA cancer datasets and compared it with the state-of-the-art methods. The result indicates that pDriver is more effective than other methods. Furthermore, pDriver can also detect miRNA cancer drivers and most of them have been confirmed to be associated with cancer by literature. We further analyse the predicted personalised drivers for breast cancer patients and the result shows that they are significantly enriched in many GO processes and KEGG pathways involved in breast cancer. Availability and implementation pDriver is available at https://github.com/pvvhoang/pDriver Contact Thuc.Le@unisa.edu.au Supplementary information Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online."

    "abstract": "In many applications, there is a need to predict the effect of an intervention on different individuals from data. For example, which customers are persuadable by a product promotion? which patients should be treated with a certain type of treatment? These are typical causal questions involving the effect or the change in outcomes made by an intervention. The questions cannot be answered with traditional classification methods as they only use associations to predict outcomes. For personalised marketing, these questions are often answered with uplift modelling. The objective of uplift modelling is to estimate causal effect, but its literature does not discuss when the uplift represents causal effect. Causal heterogeneity modelling can solve the problem, but its assumption of unconfoundedness is untestable in data. So practitioners need guidelines in their applications when using the methods. In this paper, we use causal classification for a set of personalised decision making problems, and differentiate it from classification. We discuss the conditions when causal classification can be resolved by uplift (and causal heterogeneity) modelling methods. We also propose a general framework for causal classification, by using off-the-shelf supervised methods for flexible implementations. Experiments have shown two instantiations of the framework work for causal classification and for uplift (causal heterogeneity) modelling, and are competitive with the other uplift (causal heterogeneity) modelling methods."

    "abstract": "Breast cancer prognosis is challenging due to the heterogeneity of the disease. Various computational methods using bulk RNA-seq data have been proposed for breast cancer prognosis. However, these methods suffer from limited performances or ambiguous biological relevance, as a result of the neglect of intra-tumor heterogeneity. Recently, single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) has emerged for studying tumor heterogeneity at cellular levels. In this paper, we propose a novel method, scPrognosis, to improve breast cancer prognosis with scRNA-seq data. scPrognosis uses the scRNA-seq data of the biological process Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT). It firstly infers the EMT pseudotime and a dynamic gene co-expression network, then uses an integrative model to select genes important in EMT based on their expression variation and differentiation in different stages of EMT, and their roles in the dynamic gene co-expression network. To validate and apply the selected signatures to breast cancer prognosis, we use them as the features to build a prediction model with bulk RNA-seq data. The experimental results show that scPrognosis outperforms other benchmark breast cancer prognosis methods that use bulk RNA-seq data. Moreover, the dynamic changes in the expression of the selected signature genes in EMT may provide clues to the link between EMT and clinical outcomes of breast cancer. scPrognosis will also be useful when applied to scRNA-seq datasets of different biological processes other than EMT. Author summary Various computational methods have been developed for breast cancer prognosis. However, those methods mainly use the gene expression data generated by the bulk RNA sequencing techniques, which average the expression level of a gene across different cell types. As breast cancer is a heterogenous disease, the bulk gene expression may not be the ideal resource for cancer prognosis. In this study, we propose a novel method to improve breast cancer prognosis using scRNA-seq data. The proposed method has been applied to the EMT scRNA-seq dataset for identifying breast cancer signatures for prognosis. In comparison with existing bulk expression data based methods in breast cancer prognosis, our method shows a better performance. Our single-cell-based signatures provide clues to the relation between EMT and clinical outcomes of breast cancer. In addition, the proposed method can also be useful when applied to scRNA-seq datasets of different biological processes other than EMT."

    "abstract": "Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNAseq) technologies are rapidly evolving and a growing number of datasets are now available. While very informative, in standard scRNAseq experiments the spatial organization of the cells in the organism or tissue of origin is lost. Conversely, spatial RNA-seq technologies designed to keep the localization of the cells have limited throughput and gene coverage. Mapping scRNAseq to data of genes with spatial information can thus increase coverage while providing spatial location. However, methods to perform such a mapping are still in their infancy and have not been benchmarked in an unbiased manner. To bridge the gap, we organized the DREAM Single-Cell Transcriptomics challenge to evaluate methods for reconstructing the spatial arrangement of single cells from single-cell RNA sequencing data. The challenge focused on the spatial reconstruction of cells from the Drosophila embryo from single-cell transcriptomic and, leveraging as gold standard, in situ hybridization data of a set of selected driver genes from the Berkeley Drosophila Transcription Network Project reference atlas. The 34 participating teams used an array of different algorithms for gene selection and location prediction. We devised a novel scoring and cross-validation scheme to evaluate the robustness of the best performing algorithms. Participants were able to correctly and robustly localize rare subpopulations of cells, accurately mapping both spatially co-localized and scattered groups of cells. The selection of predictor genes was essential for accurately locating the cells in the embryo. Among the most frequently selected set of genes we measured a relatively high expression entropy, high spatial clustering and the presence of prominent developmental genes such as gap and pair-ruled genes and tissue defining markers."

    "abstract": "Until now, existing methods for identifying lncRNA related miRNA sponge modules mainly rely on lncRNA related miRNA sponge interaction networks, which may not provide a full picture of miRNA sponging activities in biological conditions. Hence there is a strong need of new computational methods to identify lncRNA related miRNA sponge modules. In this work, we propose a framework, LMSM, to identify LncRNA related MiRNA Sponge Modules from heterogeneous data. To understand the miRNA sponging activities in biological conditions, LMSM uses gene expression data to evaluate the influence of the shared miRNAs on the clustered sponge lncRNAs and mRNAs. We have applied LMSM to the human breast cancer (BRCA) dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). As a result, we have found that the majority of LMSM modules are implicated in BRCA and most of them are BRCA subtype-specific. Most of the mediating miRNAs act as crosslinks across different LMSM modules. Moreover, the consistent results suggest that LMSM is robust in identifying lncRNA related miRNA sponge modules. Finally, LMSM can be used to predict miRNA targets. Altogether, our study shows that LMSM is a promising method to investigate modular regulatory mechanism of sponge lncRNAs from heterogeneous data."

    "abstract": "Abstract Epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been a subject of intense scrutiny as it facilitates metastasis and alters drug sensitivity. Although EMT-regulatory roles for numerous miRNAs and transcription factors are known, their functions can be difficult to disentangle, in part due to the difficulty in identifying direct miRNA targets from complex datasets and in deciding how to incorporate ‘indirect’ miRNA effects that may, or may not, represent biologically relevant information. To better understand how miRNAs exert effects throughout the transcriptome during EMT, we employed Exon–Intron Split Analysis (EISA), a bioinformatic technique that separates transcriptional and post-transcriptional effects through the separate analysis of RNA-Seq reads mapping to exons and introns. We find that in response to the manipulation of miRNAs, a major effect on gene expression is transcriptional. We also find extensive co-ordination of transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms during both EMT and mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET) in response to TGF-β or miR-200c respectively. The prominent transcriptional influence of miRNAs was also observed in other datasets where miRNA levels were perturbed. This work cautions against a narrow approach that is limited to the analysis of direct targets, and demonstrates the utility of EISA to examine complex regulatory networks involving both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms."

    "abstract": "In personalised decision making, evidence is required to determine whether an action (treatment) is suitable for an individual. Such evidence can be obtained by modelling treatment effect heterogeneity in subgroups. The existing interpretable modelling methods take a top-down approach to search for subgroups with heterogeneous treatment effects and they may miss the most specific and relevant context for an individual. In this paper, we design a Treatment effect pattern (TEP) to represent treatment effect heterogeneity in data. To achieve an interpretable presentation of TEPs, we use a local causal structure around the outcome to explicitly show how those important variables are used in modelling. We also derive a formula for unbiasedly estimating the Conditional Average Causal Effect (CATE) using the local structure in our problem setting. In the discovery process, we aim at minimising heterogeneity within each subgroup represented by a pattern. We propose a bottom-up search algorithm to discover the most specific patterns fitting individual circumstances the best for personalised decision making. Experiments show that the proposed method models treatment effect heterogeneity better than three other existing tree based methods in synthetic and real world data sets."

    "abstract": "The classification of clinical samples based on gene expression data is an important part of precision medicine. However, it has proved difficult to accurately predict survival outcomes and treatment responses, despite advancements in the field. In this manuscript, we show how transforming gene expression data into a set of personalized (sample-specific) networks can allow us to harness existing graph-based methods to improve classifier performance. Existing approaches to personalized gene networks, based on protein-protein interactions (PPI) or population-level models, all have the limitation that they depend on other samples in the data and must get re-computed whenever a new sample is introduced. Here, we propose a novel method, called Personalized Annotation-based Networks (PAN), that avoids this limitation by using curated annotation databases to transform gene expression data into a graph. These databases organize genes into overlapping gene sets, called annotations, that we use to build a network where nodes represent functional terms and edges represent the similarity between them. Unlike competing methods, PANs are calculated for each sample independent of the population, making it a more general solution to the single-sample network problem. Using three breast cancer datasets as a case study (METABRIC and a super-set of GEO studies), we show that PAN classifiers not only predict cancer relapse better than gene features alone, but also outperform PPI and population-level graph-based classifiers. This work demonstrates the practical advantages of graph-based classification for high-dimensional genomic data, while offering a new approach to making sample-specific networks."

    "abstract": "A key task in cancer genomics research is to identify cancer driver genes. As these genes initialise and progress cancer, understanding them is critical in designing effective cancer interventions. Although there are several methods developed to discover cancer drivers, most of them only identify coding drivers. However, non-coding RNAs can regulate driver mutations to develop cancer. Hence, novel methods are required to reveal both coding and non-coding cancer drivers. In this paper, we develop a novel framework named Controllability based Biological Network Analysis (CBNA) to uncover coding and non-coding cancer drivers (i.e. miRNA cancer drivers). CBNA integrates different genomic data types, including gene expression, gene network, mutation data, and contains a two-stage process: (1) Building a network for a condition (e.g. cancer condition) and (2) Identifying drivers. The application of CBNA to the BRCA dataset demonstrates that it is more effective than the existing methods in detecting coding cancer drivers. In addition, CBNA also predicts 17 miRNA drivers for breast cancer. Some of these predicted miRNA drivers have been validated by literature and the rest can be good candidates for wet-lab validation. We further use CBNA to detect subtype-specific cancer drivers and several predicted drivers have been confirmed to be related to breast cancer subtypes. Another application of CBNA is to discover epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) drivers. Of the predicted EMT drivers, 7 coding and 6 miRNA drivers are in the known EMT gene lists."

    "abstract": "A microRNA (miRNA) sponge is an RNA molecule with multiple tandem miRNA response elements that can sequester miRNAs from their target mRNAs. Despite growing appreciation of the importance of miRNA sponges, our knowledge of their complex functions remains limited. Moreover, there is still a lack of miRNA sponge research tools that help researchers to quickly compare their proposed methods with other methods, apply existing methods to new datasets, or select appropriate methods for assisting in subsequent experimental design. To fill the gap, we present an R/Bioconductor package, miRspongeR, for simplifying the procedure of identifying and analyzing miRNA sponge interaction networks and modules. It provides seven popular methods and an integrative method to identify miRNA sponge interactions. Moreover, it supports the validation of miRNA sponge interactions and the identification of miRNA sponge modules, as well as functional enrichment and survival analysis of miRNA sponge modules. This package enables researchers to quickly evaluate their new methods, apply existing methods to new datasets, and consequently speed up miRNA sponge research."

    "abstract": "Studying multiple microRNAs (miRNAs) synergism in gene regulation could help to understand the regulatory mechanisms of complicated human diseases caused by miRNAs. Several existing methods have been presented to infer miRNA synergism. Most of the current methods assume that miRNAs with shared targets at the sequence level are working synergistically. However, it is unclear if miRNAs with shared targets are working in concert to regulate the targets or they individually regulate the targets at different time points or different biological processes. A standard method to test the synergistic activities is to knock-down multiple miRNAs at the same time and measure the changes in the target genes. However, this approach may not be practical as we would have too many sets of miRNAs to test. n this paper, we present a novel framework called miRsyn for inferring miRNA synergism by using a causal inference method that mimics the multiple-intervention experiments, e.g. knocking-down multiple miRNAs, with observational data. Our results show that several miRNA-miRNA pairs that have shared targets at the sequence level are not working synergistically at the expression level. Moreover, the identified miRNA synergistic network is small-world and biologically meaningful, and a number of miRNA synergistic modules are significantly enriched in breast cancer. Our further analyses also reveal that most of synergistic miRNA-miRNA pairs show the same expression patterns. The comparison results indicate that the proposed multiple-intervention causal inference method performs better than the single-intervention causal inference method in identifying miRNA synergistic network. Taken together, the results imply that miRsyn is a promising framework for identifying miRNA synergism, and it could enhance the understanding of miRNA synergism in breast cancer."

    "abstract": "microRNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level and they play an important role in various biological processes in the human body. Therefore, identifying their regulation mechanisms is essential for the diagnostics and therapeutics for a wide range of diseases. There have been a large number of researches which use gene expression profiles to resolve this problem. However, the current methods have their own limitations. Some of them only identify the correlation of miRNA and mRNA expression levels instead of the causal or regulatory relationships while others infer the causality but with a high computational complexity. To overcome these issues, in this study, we propose a method to identify miRNA-mRNA regulatory relationships in breast cancer using the invariant causal prediction. The key idea of invariant causal prediction is that the cause miRNAs of their target mRNAs are the ones which have persistent causal relationships with the target mRNAs across different environments. In this research, we aim to find miRNA targets which are consistent across different breast cancer subtypes. Thus, first of all, we apply the Pam50 method to categorize BRCA samples into different \"environment\" groups based on different cancer subtypes. Then we use the invariant causal prediction method to find miRNA-mRNA regulatory relationships across subtypes. We validate the results with the miRNA-transfected experimental data and the results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. In addition, we also integrate this new method with the Pearson correlation analysis method and Lasso in an ensemble method to take the advantages of these methods. We then validate the results of the ensemble method with the experimentally confirmed data and the ensemble method shows the best performance, even comparing to the proposed causal method. This research found miRNA targets which are consistent across different breast cancer subtypes. Further functional enrichment analysis shows that miRNAs involved in the regulatory relationships predicated by the proposed methods tend to synergistically regulate target genes, indicating the usefulness of these methods, and the identified miRNA targets could be used in the design of wet-lab experiments to discover the causes of breast cancer."

    "abstract": "Estimating heterogeneous treatment effect is a fundamental problem in biological and medical applications. Recently, several recursive partitioning methods have been proposed to identify the subgroups that respond differently towards a treatment, and they rely on a fitness criterion to minimize the error between the estimated treatment effects and the unobservable ground truths. In this paper, we propose that a heterogeneity criterion, which maximizes the differences of treatment effects among the subgroups, also needs to be considered. Moreover, we show that better performances can be achieved when the fitness and the heterogeneous criteria are considered simultaneously. Selecting the optimal splitting points then becomes a multi-objective problem; however, a solution that achieves optimal in both aspects are often not available. To solve this problem, we propose a multi-objective splitting procedure to balance both criteria. The proposed procedure is computationally efficient and fits naturally into the existing recursive partitioning framework. Experimental results show that the proposed multi-objective approach performs consistently better than existing ones. Heterogeneity should be considered with fitness in heterogeneous treatment effect estimation, and the proposed multi-objective splitting procedure achieves the best performance by balancing both criteria."

    "abstract": "BackgroundmiRBase is the primary repository for published miRNA sequence and annotation data, and serves as the “go-to” place for miRNA research. However, the definition and annotation of miRNAs have been changed significantly across different versions of miRBase. The changes cause inconsistency in miRNA related data between different databases and articles published at different times. Several tools have been developed for different purposes of querying and converting the information of miRNAs between different miRBase versions, but none of them individually can provide the comprehensive information about miRNAs in miRBase and users will need to use a number of different tools in their analyses.ResultsWe introduce miRBaseConverter, an R package integrating the latest miRBase version 22 available in Bioconductor to provide a suite of functions for converting and retrieving miRNA name (ID), accession, sequence, species, version and family information in different versions of miRBase. The package is implemented in R and available under the GPL-2 license from the Bioconductor website (http://bioconductor.org/packages/miRBaseConverter/). A Shiny-based GUI suitable for non-R users is also available as a standalone application from the package and also as a web application at http://nugget.unisa.edu.au:3838/miRBaseConverter. miRBaseConverter has a built-in database for querying miRNA information in all species and for both pre-mature and mature miRNAs defined by miRBase. In addition, it is the first tool for batch querying the miRNA family information. The package aims to provide a comprehensive and easy-to-use tool for miRNA research community where researchers often utilize published miRNA data from different sources.ConclusionsThe Bioconductor package miRBaseConverter and the Shiny-based web application are presented to provide a suite of functions for converting and retrieving miRNA name, accession, sequence, species, version and family information in different versions of miRBase. The package will serve a wide range of applications in miRNA research and could provide a full view of the miRNAs of interest."

    "abstract": "With the increasing need of personalised decision making, such as personalised medicine and online recommendations, a growing attention has been paid to the discovery of the context and heterogeneity of causal relationships. Most existing methods, however, assume a known cause (e.g. a new drug) and focus on identifying from data the contexts of heterogeneous effects of the cause (e.g. patient groups with different responses to the new drug). There is no approach to efficiently detecting directly from observational data context specific causal relationships, i.e. discovering the causes and their contexts simultaneously. In this paper, by taking the advantages of highly efficient decision tree induction and the well established causal inference framework, we propose the Tree based Context Causal rule discovery (TCC) method, for efficient exploration of context specific causal relationships from data. Experiments with both synthetic and real world data sets show that TCC can effectively discover context specific causal rules from the data."

    "abstract": "Motivation: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non‐coding RNAs with the length of ˜22 nucleotides. miRNAs are involved in many biological processes including cancers. Recent studies show that long non‐coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as miRNA sponges, playing important roles in cancer physiology and development. Despite accumulating appreciation of the importance of lncRNAs, the study of their complex functions is still in its preliminary stage. Based on the hypothesis of competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs), several computational methods have been proposed for investigating the competitive relationships between lncRNAs and miRNA target messenger RNAs (mRNAs). However, when the mRNAs are released from the control of miRNAs, it remains largely unknown as to how the sponge lncRNAs influence the expression levels of the endogenous miRNA targets. Results: We propose a novel method to construct lncRNA related miRNA sponge regulatory networks (LncmiRSRNs) by integrating matched lncRNA and mRNA expression profiles with clinical information and putative miRNA‐target interactions. Using the method, we have constructed the LncmiRSRNs for four human cancers (glioblastoma multiforme, lung cancer, ovarian cancer and prostate cancer). Based on the networks, we discover that after being released from miRNA control, the target mRNAs are normally up‐regulated by the sponge lncRNAs, and only a fraction of sponge lncRNA‐mRNA regulatory relationships and hub lncRNAs are shared by the four cancers. Moreover, most sponge lncRNA‐mRNA regulatory relationships show a rewired mode between different cancers, and a minority of sponge lncRNA‐mRNA regulatory relationships conserved (appearing) in different cancers may act as a common pivot across cancers. Besides, differential and conserved hub lncRNAs may act as potential cancer drivers to influence the cancerous state in cancers. Functional enrichment and survival analysis indicate that the identified differential and conserved LncmiRSRN network modules work as functional units in biological processes, and can distinguish metastasis risks of cancers. Our analysis demonstrates the potential of integrating expression profiles, clinical information and miRNA‐target interactions for investigating lncRNA regulatory mechanism. Availability and implementation: LncmiRSRN is freely available (https://github.com/zhangjunpeng411/LncmiRSRN). Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online."

    "abstract": "Antifungal agents for the treatment of Candida albicans infections are limited. We recently discovered a novel antifungal small molecule, SM21, with promising in vivo activity. Herein, we employed the newly developed C. albicans haploid toolbox to uncover the mechanism of action of SM21. Comprehensive RNA-Seq analyses of the haploid susceptible GZY803 strain revealed significant gene expression changes related to mitochondria when exposed to SM21. Mitochondrial structure visualization and measurement of ATP generation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, and the antioxidant potential of SM21-treated and untreated GZY803, mitochondrial structure defective haploid mutant (dnm1Δ), and wild-type diploid SC5314 strains confirmed defects in mitochondria. Exploiting the advantage of C. albicans haploids as a single ploidy model, we further exposed GZY803 to repetitive treatments of SM21 in order to generate resistant mutants. Three colonies designated S3, S5 and S6, which displayed resistance to SM21, were isolated. All resistant strains exhibited enhanced transcriptomic responses for peptide and protein metabolism and secreted aspartate proteases (SAPs) activity under SM21 treatment compared to the parent strain GZY803. Consistently, supplementing the resistant strains, GZY803, and SC5314 with peptone, a form of digested peptides, decreased susceptibility to SM21. The present study demonstrates the usefulness of haploid C. albicans model in antifungal drug discovery. The findings will be invaluable to develop SM21 as a novel antifungal agent, which will benefit millions of patients suffering from Candida infections."

    "abstract": "miRBase is the primary repository for published miRNA sequence and annotation data, and serves as the “go-to” place for miRNA research. However, the definition and annotation of miRNAs have been changed significantly across different versions of miRBase. The changes cause inconsistency in miRNA related data between different databases and articles published at different times. Several tools have been developed for different purposes of querying and converting the information of miRNAs between different miRBase versions, but none of them individually can provide the comprehensive information about miRNAs in miRBase and users will need to use a number of different tools in their analyses. We introduce miRBaseConverter, an R package integrating the latest miRBase version 22 available in Bioconductor to provide a suite of functions for converting and retrieving miRNA name (ID), accession, sequence, species, version and family information in different versions of miRBase. The package is implemented in R and available under the GPL-2 license from the Bioconductor website (http://bioconductor.org/packages/miRBaseConverter/). A Shiny-based GUI suitable for non-R users is also available as a standalone application from the package and also as a web application at http://nugget.unisa.edu.au:3838/miRBaseConverter. miRBaseConverter has a built-in database for querying miRNA information in all species and for both pre-mature and mature miRNAs defined by miRBase. In addition, it is the first tool for batch querying the miRNA family information. The package aims to provide a comprehensive and easy-to-use tool for miRNA research community where researchers often utilize published miRNA data from different sources. The Bioconductor package miRBaseConverter and the Shiny-based web application are presented to provide a suite of functions for converting and retrieving miRNA name, accession, sequence, species, version and family information in different versions of miRBase. The package will serve a wide range of applications in miRNA research and could provide a full view of the miRNAs of interest."

    "abstract": "Outliers are objects that are significantly different from the others in the same dataset. They often contain insightful information for understanding the data and the data generation process. Traditional outlier detection methods can generally be divided into two categories: model-based and proximity-based approaches. A new type of model-based approach has recently been proposed to use the Bayesian network (BN) framework to discover more meaningful outliers with better interpretability. They yield very good detection result when anomalousness is mainly due to the violation of the dependency among variables. However, when anomalousness is caused by reasons other than dependency violation, BN-based methods produce very poor performance. To address this problem, we propose an ensemble outlier detection method that combines BN-based and proximity-based techniques to achieve more stable outlier detection results in different scenarios. To our best knowledge, the proposed method is the first to bring together the two major categories of outlier detection techniques. Comprehensive experiments have been done on both synthetic and real world datasets, and the results show that our method outperforms the baseline methods in most cases."

    "abstract": "Predictive models such as decision trees and neural networks may produce discrimination in their predictions. This paper proposes a method to post-process the predictions of a predictive model to make the processed predictions non-discriminatory. The method considers multiple protected variables together. Multiple protected variables make the problem more challenging than a simple protected variable. The method uses a well-cited discrimination metric and adapts it to allow the specification of explanatory variables, such as position, profession, education, that describe the contexts of the applications. It models the post-processing of predictions problem as a nonlinear optimization problem to find best adjustments to the predictions so that the discrimination constraints of all protected variables are all met at the same time. The proposed method is independent of classification methods. It can handle the cases that existing methods cannot handle: satisfying multiple protected attributes at the same time, allowing multiple explanatory attributes, and being independent of classification model types. An evaluation using four real world data sets shows that the proposed method is as effectively as existing methods, in addition to its extra power."

    "abstract": "Recent studies have shown that the crosstalk between microRNA (miRNA) sponges plays an important role in human cancers. However, the co-regulation roles of miRNA sponges in protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are still unknown. In this study, we propose a multi-step method called miRSCoPPI to infer miRNA sponge co-regulation of PPIs. We focus on investigating breast cancer (BRCA) related miRNA sponge co-regulation, by integrating heterogeneous data, including miRNA, long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) and messenger RNA (mRNA) expression data, experimentally validated miRNA-target interactions, PPIs and lncRNA-target interactions, and the list of breast cancer genes. We find that the inferred BRCA-related miRSCoPPI network is highly connected and scale free. The top 10% hub genes in the BRCA-related miRSCoPPI network have potential biological implications in breast cancer. By utilizing a graph clustering method, we discover 17 BRCA-related miRSCoPPI modules. Through pathway enrichment analysis of the modules, we find that several modules are significantly enriched in pathways associated with breast cancer. Moreover, 10 modules have good performance in classifying breast tumor and normal samples, and can act as module signatures for prognostication. By using putative computationally predicted miRNA-target interactions, we have consistent results with those obtained using experimentally validated miRNA-target interactions, indicating that miRSCoPPI is robust in inferring miRNA sponge co-regulation of PPIs in human breast cancer. Taken together, the results demonstrate that miRSCoPPI is a promising tool for inferring BRCA-related miRNA sponge co-regulation of PPIs and it can help with the understanding of the co-regulation roles of miRNA sponges on the PPIs."

    "abstract": "Cross-view data are collected from two different views or sources about the same subjects. As the information from these views often consolidate and/or complement each other, cross-view data analysis can gain more insights for decision making. A main challenge of cross-view data analysis is how to effectively explore the inherently correlated and high-dimensional data. Dimension reduction offers an effective solution for this problem. However, how to choose right models and parameters involved for dimension reduction is still an open problem. In this paper, we propose an effective sparse learning algorithm for cross-view dimensionality reduction. A distinguished character of our model selection is that it is nonparametric and automatic. Specifically, we represent the correlation of cross-view data using a covariance matrix. Then, we decompose the matrix into a sequence of low-rank ones by solving an optimization problem in an alternating least squares manner. More importantly, a new and nonparametric sparsity-inducing function is developed to derive a parsimonious model. Extensive experiments are conducted on real-world data sets to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The results show that our method is competitive with the state-of-the-art sparse learning algorithms."

    "abstract": "MicroRNA (miRNA) sponges with multiple tandem miRNA binding sequences can sequester miRNAs from their endogenous target mRNAs. Therefore, miRNA sponge acting as a decoy is extremely important for long-term loss-of-function studies both in vivo and in silico. Recently, a growing number of in silico methods have been used as an effective technique to generate hypotheses for in vivo methods for studying the biological functions and regulatory mechanisms of miRNA sponges. However, most existing in silico methods only focus on studying miRNA sponge interactions or networks in cancer, the module-level properties of miRNA sponges in cancer is still largely unknown. We propose a novel in silico method, called miRSM (miRNA Sponge Module) to infer miRNA sponge modules in breast cancer. We apply miRSM to the breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA) dataset provided by The Cancer Genome Altas (TCGA), and make functional validation of the computational results. We discover that most miRNA sponge interactions are module-conserved across two modules, and a minority of miRNA sponge interactions are module-specific, existing only in a single module. Through functional annotation and differential expression analysis, we also find that the modules discovered using miRSM are functional miRNA sponge modules associated with BRCA. Moreover, the module-specific miRNA sponge interactions among miRNA sponge modules may be involved in the progression and development of BRCA. Our experimental results show that miRSM is comparable to the benchmark methods in recovering experimentally confirmed miRNA sponge interactions, and miRSM outperforms the benchmark methods in identifying interactions that are related to breast cancer. Altogether, the functional validation results demonstrate that miRSM is a promising method to identify miRNA sponge modules and interactions, and may provide new insights for understanding the roles of miRNA sponges in cancer progression and development."

    "abstract": "Motivation microRNAs (miRNAs) play crucial roles in post-transcriptional gene regulation of both plants and mammals, and dysfunctions of miRNAs are often associated with tumorigenesis and development through the effects on their target messenger RNAs (mRNAs). Identifying miRNA functions is critical for understanding cancer mechanisms and determining the efficacy of drugs. Computational methods analyzing high-throughput data offer great assistance in understanding the diverse and complex relationships between miRNAs and mRNAs. However, most of the existing methods do not fully utilise the available knowledge in biology to reduce the uncertainty in the modeling process. Therefore it is desirable to develop a method that can seamlessly integrate existing biological knowledge and high-throughput data into the process of discovering miRNA regulation mechanisms. Results In this article we present an integrative framework, CIDER (Causal miRNA target Discovery with Expression profile and Regulatory knowledge), to predict miRNA targets. CIDER is able to utilise a variety of gene regulation knowledge, including transcriptional and post-transcriptional knowledge, and to exploit gene expression data for the discovery of miRNA-mRNA regulatory relationships. The benefits of our framework is demonstrated by both simulation study and the analysis of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the breast cancer (BRCA) datasets. Our results reveal that even a limited amount of either Transcription Factor (TF)-miRNA or miRNA-mRNA regulatory knowledge improves the performance of miRNA target prediction, and the combination of the two types of knowledge enhances the improvement further. Another useful property of the framework is that its performance increases monotonically with the increase of regulatory knowledge."

    "abstract": "Background Identifying cancer subtypes is an important component of the personalised medicine framework. An increasing number of computational methods have been developed to identify cancer subtypes. However, existing methods rarely use information from gene regulatory networks to facilitate the subtype identification. It is widely accepted that gene regulatory networks play crucial roles in understanding the mechanisms of diseases. Different cancer subtypes are likely caused by different regulatory mechanisms. Therefore, there are great opportunities for developing methods that can utilise network information in identifying cancer subtypes. Results In this paper, we propose a method, weighted similarity network fusion (WSNF), to utilise the information in the complex miRNA-TF-mRNA regulatory network in identifying cancer subtypes. We firstly build the regulatory network where the nodes represent the features, i.e. the microRNAs (miRNAs), transcription factors (TFs) and messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and the edges indicate the interactions between the features. The interactions are retrieved from various interatomic databases. We then use the network information and the expression data of the miRNAs, TFs and mRNAs to calculate the weight of the features, representing the level of importance of the features. The feature weight is then integrated into a network fusion approach to cluster the samples (patients) and thus to identify cancer subtypes. We applied our method to the TCGA breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA) and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) datasets. The experimental results show that WSNF performs better than the other commonly used computational methods, and the information from miRNA-TF-mRNA regulatory network contributes to the performance improvement. The WSNF method successfully identified five breast cancer subtypes and three GBM subtypes which show significantly different survival patterns. We observed that the expression patterns of the features in some miRNA-TF-mRNA sub-networks vary across different identified subtypes. In addition, pathway enrichment analyses show that the top pathways involving the most differentially expressed genes in each of the identified subtypes are different. The results would provide valuable information for understanding the mechanisms characterising different cancer subtypes and assist the design of treatment therapies. All datasets and the R scripts to reproduce the results are available online at the website: http://nugget.unisa.edu.au/Thuc/cancersubtypes/."

    "abstract": "microRNAs (miRNAs) play an essential role in the post-transcriptional gene regulation in plants and animals. They regulate a wide range of biological processes by targeting messenger RNAs (mRNAs). Evidence suggests that miRNAs and mRNAs interact collectively in gene regulatory networks. The collective relationships between groups of miRNAs and groups of mRNAs may be more readily interpreted than those between individual miRNAs and mRNAs, and thus are useful for gaining insight into gene regulation and cell functions. Several computational approaches have been developed to discover miRNA-mRNA regulatory modules (MMRMs) with a common aim to elucidate miRNA-mRNA regulatory relationships. However, most existing methods do not consider the collective relationships between a group of miRNAs and the group of targeted mRNAs in the process of discovering MMRMs. Our aim is to develop a framework to discover MMRMs and reveal miRNA-mRNA regulatory relationships from the heterogeneous expression data based on the collective relationships. We propose DIscovering COllective group RElationships (DICORE), an effective computational framework for revealing miRNA-mRNA regulatory relationships. We utilize the notation of collective group relationships to build the computational framework. The method computes the collaboration scores of the miRNAs and mRNAs on the basis of their interactions with mRNAs and miRNAs, respectively. Then it determines the groups of miRNAs and groups of mRNAs separately based on their respective collaboration scores. Next, it calculates the strength of the collective relationship between each pair of miRNA group and mRNA group using canonical correlation analysis, and the group pairs with significant canonical correlations are considered as the MMRMs. We applied this method to three gene expression datasets, and validated the computational discoveries. Analysis of the results demonstrates that a large portion of the regulatory relationships discovered by DICORE is consistent with the experimentally confirmed databases. Furthermore, it is observed that the top mRNAs that are regulated by the miRNAs in the identified MMRMs are highly relevant to the biological conditions of the given datasets. It is also shown that the MMRMs identified by DICORE are more biologically significant and functionally enriched."

    "abstract": "Discovering causal relationships from data is the ultimate goal of many research areas. Constraint based causal exploration algorithms, such as PC, FCI, RFCI, PC-simple, IDA and Joint-IDA have achieved significant progress and have many applications. A common problem with these methods is the high computational complexity, which hinders their applications in real world high dimensional datasets, e.g gene expression datasets. In this paper, we present an R package, ParallelPC, that includes the parallelised versions of these causal exploration algorithms. The parallelised algorithms help speed up the procedure of experimenting big datasets and reduce the memory used when running the algorithms. The package is not only suitable for super-computers or clusters, but also convenient for researchers using personal computers with multi core CPUs. Our experiment results on real world datasets show that using the parallelised algorithms it is now practical to explore causal relationships in high dimensional datasets with thousands of variables in a single multicore computer. ParallelPC is available in CRAN repository at this https URL"

    "abstract": "microRNAs (miRNAs) are important gene regulators at post-transcriptional level, and inferring miRNA-mRNA regulatory relationships is a crucial problem. Consequently, several computational methods of predicting miRNA targets have been proposed using expression data with or without sequence based miRNA target information. A typical procedure for applying and evaluating such a method is i) collecting matched miRNA and mRNA expression profiles in a specific condition, e.g. a cancer dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), ii) applying the new computational method to the selected dataset, iii) validating the predictions against knowledge from literature and third-party databases, and comparing the performance of the method with some existing methods. This procedure is time consuming given the time elapsed when collecting and processing data, repeating the work from existing methods, searching for knowledge from literature and third-party databases to validate the results, and comparing the results from different methods. The time consuming procedure prevents researchers from quickly testing new computational models, analysing new datasets, and selecting suitable methods for assisting with the experiment design. Here, we present an R package, miRLAB, for automating the procedure of inferring and validating miRNA-mRNA regulatory relationships. The package provides a complete set of pipelines for testing new methods and analysing new datasets. miRLAB includes a pipeline to obtain matched miRNA and mRNA expression datasets directly from TCGA, 12 benchmark computational methods for inferring miRNA-mRNA regulatory relationships, the functions for validating the predictions using experimentally validated miRNA target data and miRNA perturbation data, and the tools for comparing the results from different computational methods."

    "abstract": "Background microRNAs (miRNAs) are short regulatory RNAs that are involved in several diseases, including cancers. Identifying miRNA functions is very important in understanding disease mechanisms and determining the efficacy of drugs. An increasing number of computational methods have been developed to explore miRNA functions by inferring the miRNA-mRNA regulatory relationships from data. Each of the methods is developed based on some assumptions and constraints, for instance, assuming linear relationships between variables. For such reasons, computational methods are often subject to the problem of inconsistent performance across different datasets. On the other hand, ensemble methods integrate the results from individual methods and have been proved to outperform each of their individual component methods in theory. Results In this paper, we investigate the performance of some ensemble methods over the commonly used miRNA target prediction methods. We apply eight different popular miRNA target prediction methods to three cancer datasets, and compare their performance with the ensemble methods which integrate the results from each combination of the individual methods. The validation results using experimentally confirmed databases show that the results of the ensemble methods complement those obtained by the individual methods and the ensemble methods perform better than the individual methods across different datasets. The ensemble method, Pearson+IDA+Lasso, which combines methods in different approaches, including a correlation method, a causal inference method, and a regression method, is the best performed ensemble method in this study. Further analysis of the results of this ensemble method shows that the ensemble method can obtain more targets which could not be found by any of the single methods, and the discovered targets are more statistically significant and functionally enriched. The source codes, datasets, miRNA target predictions by all methods, and the ground truth for validation are available in the Supplementary materials."

    "abstract": "Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are the most effective approach to causal discovery, but in many circumstances it is impossible to conduct RCTs. Therefore, observational studies based on passively observed data are widely accepted as an alternative to RCTs. However, in observational studies, prior knowledge is required to generate the hypotheses about the cause-effect relationships to be tested, and hence they can only be applied to problems with available domain knowledge and a handful of variables. In practice, many datasets are of high dimensionality, which leaves observational studies out of the opportunities for causal discovery from such a wealth of data sources. In another direction, many efficient data mining methods have been developed to identify associations among variables in large datasets. The problem is that causal relationships imply associations, but the reverse is not always true. However, we can see the synergy between the two paradigms here. Specifically, association rule mining can be used to deal with the high-dimensionality problem, whereas observational studies can be utilised to eliminate noncausal associations. In this article, we propose the concept of causal rules (CRs) and develop an algorithm for mining CRs in large datasets. We use the idea of retrospective cohort studies to detect CRs based on the results of association rule mining. Experiments with both synthetic and real-world datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of CR mining. In comparison with the commonly used causal discovery methods, the proposed approach generally is faster and has better or competitive performance in finding correct or sensible causes. It is also capable of finding a cause consisting of multiple variables—a feature that other causal discovery methods do not possess."

    "abstract": "Uncovering causal relationships in data is a major objective of data analytics. Currently, there is a need for scalable and automated methods for causal relationship exploration in data. Classification methods are fast and they could be practical substitutes for finding causal signals in data. However, classification methods are not designed for causal discovery and a classification method may find false causal signals and miss the true ones. In this paper, we develop a causal decision tree (CDT) where nodes have causal interpretations. Our method follows a well-established causal inference framework and makes use of a classic statistical test to establish the causal relationship between a predictor variable and the outcome variable. At the same time, by taking the advantages of normal decision trees, a CDT provides a compact graphical representation of the causal relationships, and the construction of a CDT is fast as a result of the divide and conquer strategy employed, making CDTs practical for representing and finding causal signals in large data sets. Experiment results demonstrate that CDTs can identify meaningful causal relationships and the CDT algorithm is scalable."

    "abstract": "Discovering causal relationships from observational data is a crucial problem and it has applications in many research areas. The PC algorithm is the state-of-the-art constraint based method for causal discovery. However, runtime of the PC algorithm, in the worst-case, is exponential to the number of nodes (variables), and thus it is inefficient when being applied to high dimensional data, e.g., gene expression datasets. On another note, the advancement of computer hardware in the last decade has resulted in the widespread availability of multi-core personal computers. There is a significant motivation for designing a parallelized PC algorithm that is suitable for personal computers and does not require end users’ parallel computing knowledge beyond their competency in using the PC algorithm. In this paper, we develop parallel-PC, a fast and memory efficient PC algorithm using the parallel computing technique. We apply our method to a range of synthetic and real-world high dimensional datasets. Experimental results on a dataset from the DREAM 5 challenge show that the original PC algorithm could not produce any results after running more than 24 hours; meanwhile, our parallel-PC algorithm managed to finish within around 12 hours with a 4-core CPU computer, and less than six hours with a 8-core CPU computer. Furthermore, we integrate parallel-PC into a causal inference method for inferring miRNA-mRNA regulatory relationships. The experimental results show that parallel-PC helps improve both the efficiency and accuracy of the causal inference algorithm."

    "abstract": "Transcription factors (TFs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) are primary metazoan gene regulators. Regulatory mechanisms of the two main regulators are of great interest to biologists and may provide insights into the causes of diseases. However, the interplay between miRNAs and TFs in a regulatory network still remains unearthed. Currently, it is very difficult to study the regulatory mechanisms that involve both miRNAs and TFs in a biological lab. Even at data level, a network involving miRNAs, TFs and genes will be too complicated to achieve. Previous research has been mostly directed at inferring either miRNA or TF regulatory networks from data. However, networks involving a single type of regulator may not fully reveal the complex gene regulatory mechanisms, for instance, the way in which a TF indirectly regulates a gene via a miRNA. We propose a framework to learn from heterogeneous data the three-component regulatory networks, with the presence of miRNAs, TFs, and mRNAs. This method firstly utilises Bayesian network structure learning to construct a regulatory network from multiple sources of data: gene expression profiles of miRNAs, TFs and mRNAs, target information based on sequence data, and sample categories. Then, in order to produce more meaningful results for further biological experimentation and research, the method searches the learnt network to identify the interplay between miRNAs and TFs and applies a network motif finding algorithm to further infer the network. We apply the proposed framework to the data sets of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The results elucidate the complex gene regulatory mechanism for EMT which involves both TFs and miRNAs. Several discovered interactions and molecular functions have been confirmed by literature. In addition, many other discovered interactions and bio-markers are of high statistical significance and thus can be good candidates for validation by experiments. Moreover, the results generated by our method are compact, involving a small number of interactions which have been proved highly relevant to EMT. We have designed a framework to infer gene regulatory networks involving both TFs and miRNAs from multiple sources of data, including gene expression data, target information, and sample categories. Results on the EMT data sets have shown that the proposed approach is able to produce compact and meaningful gene regulatory networks that are highly relevant to the biological conditions of the data sets. This framework has the potential for application to other heterogeneous datasets to reveal the complex gene regulatory relationships."

    "abstract": "Discovering causal relationships in large databases of observational data is challenging. The pioneering work in this area was rooted in the theory of Bayesian network (BN) learning, which however, is a NP-complete problem. Hence several constraint-based algorithms have been developed to efficiently discover causations in large databases. These methods usually use the idea of BN learning, directly or indirectly, and are focused on causal relationships with single cause variables. In this paper, we propose an approach to mine causal rules in large databases of binary variables. Our method expands the scope of causality discovery to causal relationships with multiple cause variables, and we utilise partial association tests to exclude noncausal associations, to ensure the high reliability of discovered causal rules. Furthermore an efficient algorithm is designed for the tests in large databases. We assess the method with a set of real-world diagnostic data. The results show that our method can effectively discover interesting causal rules in large databases."
